# generic-list
A basic api based list app.

Could use it for a Grocery List, ToDo, or anything else you want. Easy, fast, clean. Will add a demo page.  API based.

Routes: GET /list, DELETE /{id}, POST /list/{item}

Currently no ability to edit an item.

You just need to setup a mongo database and supply the database details.
